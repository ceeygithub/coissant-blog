        <div class="container py-4">
            <p class="text-start">Across various accounts of croissant history, most sources agree that it originates
                from
                Austria as the kipferl. Made
                from a yeasted wheat dough, the kipferl is a baked bread roll common in Central Europe. Records state
                that
                the kipferl
                has been around as early as the 13th century, but many believe it may be even older. Popular myths
                attribute
                its
                invention as a celebration of the Ottoman Empire’s defeat in the Battle of Vienna; the crescent shape
                represented the
                moon on the Ottoman flag.

                “These stories are almost certainly untrue,” Austrian native Chef Jürgen says.

                Regardless of the kipferl’s origins, it would migrate to France later in the 19th century.

                In another common legend, Marie Antoinette is said to have introduced the kipferl to French court,
                homesick
                for foods
                from Austria. While it’s a romantic story, there are no historical records to back up this retelling.

                The earliest recorded introduction of the kipferl to France occurred in 1839, when Austrian artillery
                officer August
                Zang founded a Viennese bakery in Paris. Parisians fell in love with the kipferl (and with Viennese
                baking
                as a whole),
                and imitated the bread in their own shops. The name "croissant" also began appearing in historical
                record,
                referring to
                the crescent shape of the bread.

                In 1915, Sylvain Claudius Goy recorded the first-known French version of the croissant recipe. Instead
                of
                brioche dough,
                as August Zang used, Goy transformed the recipe to use a laminated yeast dough. Lamination involves
                folding
                butter and
                dough to create thin, flaky layers of pastry.

                And thus, the iconic French pastry we know and love today was born.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">The classic crescent-shaped French pastry is made from a yeast-based dough,
                        which
                        is rolled and
                        layered to incorporate
                        butter. Because of the cost of butter, many bakers use cheaper substitutes such as margarine,
                        which
                        means that most
                        bakeries in France offer two types of croissants: croissant and croissant au beurre (“croissant
                        with
                        butter”). The
                        former tends to be more breadlike, whereas the latter is much richer and, predictably, more
                        buttery.
                        A popular habit
                        among bakers is to bend the butterless croissant into a distinctive curve while straightening
                        out
                        the croissant au
                        beurre so as to distinguish clearly between the two.

                        Golden, buttery croissants should be crisp and flaky on the outside and soft and tender on the
                        inside, with a texture
                        that can be almost pulled apart The classic
                        sweet-filled croissants use almonds, marzipan, or chocolate, whereas savory croissants might be
                        filled variously with
                        cheese, spinach, or ham.

                    <div>
                        <h4>Step 1</h4>
                        <p>In the bowl of your mixer, add the warm milk, brown sugar, and yeast. Give it a quick stir
                            with a
                            fork or small whisk
                            and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until the yeast foams up well.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>Step 2</h4>
                        <p>To your bloomed yeast, add the flour and salt. Use the dough hook on your mixer and let the
                            dough
                            knead for about 5
                            minutes on low speed. The dough should turn out nice, soft, elastic, and slightly sticky.
                            Because of varying environment
                            conditions, you may need more flour than I used. Add 1 tbsp at a time until your dough feels
                            perfect. Knead the dough by
                            hand for a few minutes, then add it back to the bowl. Wrap the bowl well with plastic and
                            let
                            the dough sit in the
                            fridge for 1 hour.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>Step 3</h4>
                        <p>Arrange the sticks of butter on a sheet of plastic wrap horizontally. Lay another piece of
                            plastic over the sticks, and
                            use a rolling pin to flatten the sticks until you have approximately an 8×5 inch rectangle.
                            Put
                            the butter, still
                            wrapped in plastic, in the fridge until the dough is ready.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>Step 4</h4>
                        <p>Laminating dough is the process of folding butter into the dough many times, which is what
                            creates all those layers.
                            Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll it to a 16×10 inch rectangle.
                            Place
                            your butter in the
                            center, and fold the edges of the dough rectangle over to cover the butter completely. Roll
                            the
                            dough out so it’s back
                            to 16×10 inches, then fold it letter-style into thirds. Wrap the dough with plastic and
                            place it
                            in the fridge for an
                            hour. I like to repeat this process a total of 5 times giving us a total of 729 layers.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h4>Step 5</h4>
                        <p>Roll the dough out, one last time, until you have a long rectangle about 1/4″ thick. I like
                            to
                            cut the dough into thirds
                            to make this part easier. Slice the dough into long triangles, and roll each one starting at
                            the
                            wide end until you have
                            a crescent shape. Brush with a lightly beaten egg, and bake on a parchment paper lined sheet
                            for
                            8-12 minutes at 400F,
                            then turn the oven down to 375 and bake for another 8-12 minutes.
